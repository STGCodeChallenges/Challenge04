<h3>Michael's implementation of Code Challenge 4</h3>

I didn't have the time to convert my application into Swing, so I coded this application in straight Java, which can be easily launched from your favorite IDE console, or ran from the Operating System command prompt.

When running from the command prompt, make sure to build the class correctly using javac before running it directly.
<ul>
  <li>Compile: javac ExpressionSolve.java</li>
  <li>Execute: java ExpressionSolve</li>
  <li>Running: Enter a mathmatical expression for evalution.</li>
  <li>Use the rules of arithmetic, allowing for parenthesis.</li>
  <li>It is understood that the statement entered will not result in decimal operations.</li>
  <li>Standard Operators are allowed: +, -, /, *, ( )</li>
</ul>
